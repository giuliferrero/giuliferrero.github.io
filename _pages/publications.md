      Can governments rapidly reshape social and gender norms through mass
      media in response to large economic shocks? I focus on the U.S. home
      front during World War II, when severe labor shortages prompted the
      federal government to actively promote women’s employment through
      nationwide media campaigns. To examine how this effort reshaped public
      discourse, I construct a new dataset combining historical newspapers
      with a newly digitized archive of women’s magazines, allowing the
      tracing of changes in representations of women before, during, and
      after the war. Exploiting local variation in war-induced labor
      shortages and using an event-study design, I document a pronounced
      wartime shift toward portraying women as workers, followed by a rapid
      retreat once the war ended. While these narratives were short-lived,
      areas more exposed to wartime pressures experienced a more persistent
      increase in the visibility of women in public discourse. I then examine
      whether exposure to wartime narratives influenced postwar attitudes
      toward women’s roles. Combining historical survey data with a
      shift-share strategy based on magazine circulation and content, the
      results suggest that institutional messaging can rapidly reshape social
      narratives, with effects that may persist beyond the original economic
      shock even as economic conditions revert.

Armenia and Azerbaijan, engaged in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, are known for their strong son preference and widespread use of abortion. In such a peculiar setting, we ask: does ethnic conflict affect son preference? By merging Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data with two different sources of conflict-related casualties, we investigate the effect of ethnic conflict on fertility decisions. To do so, we leverage variations in geographic and temporal exposure to conflict-related violence in the context of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–1994), alongside variation in the gender composition of children between families. We find that families with only daughters exposed to conflict increase their fertility in the very short term. Furthermore, our analysis of births by gender reveals that this result is driven by the birth of sons. Conflict intensifies son preference, manifesting in son-targeted fertility behavior and sex-selective abortions. Lastly, we identify child replacement as a mechanism contributing to the increase in fertility, driven primarily by the replacement of male children.
