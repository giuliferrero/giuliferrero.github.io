    <p>
      Can governments rapidly reshape social and gender norms through mass
    media in response to large economic shocks? I focus on the U.S. home
    front during World War II, when severe labor shortages prompted the
    federal government to actively promote women’s employment through
    nationwide media campaigns. To examine how this effort reshaped public
    discourse, I construct a new dataset combining historical newspapers
    with a newly digitized archive of women’s magazines, allowing the
    tracing of changes in representations of women before, during, and
    after the war. Exploiting local variation in war-induced labor
    shortages and using an event-study design, I document a pronounced
    wartime shift toward portraying women as workers, followed by a rapid
    retreat once the war ended. While these narratives were short-lived,
    areas more exposed to wartime pressures experienced a more persistent
    increase in the visibility of women in public discourse. I then examine
    whether exposure to wartime narratives influenced postwar attitudes
    toward women’s roles. Combining historical survey data with a
    shift-share strategy based on magazine circulation and content, the
    results suggest that institutional messaging can rapidly reshape social
    narratives, with effects that may persist beyond the original economic
    shock even as economic conditions revert.
