**Welcome!**

I am a PhD student at the University of Turin and a Phd fellow at [Collegio
Carlo Alberto](https://www.phdpareto.carloalberto.org/giulia-ferrero/), working under the supervision of [Elena Esposito](https://www.elenaesposito.com/) and [Giovanni Mastrobuoni](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannimastrobuoni/).

I am an applied micro-economist specializing in economic history, media, and development
economics with a particular focus on gender. 

My research examines how societal and cultural norms around women evolve, particularly in response to historical and
contemporary events, including conflicts as potential catalysts for change. I analyze narratives
using archival media sources such as newspapers, women’s magazines, and movies.

I hold a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna.
